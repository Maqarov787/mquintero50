## DISCO:
- Source code taken from NASA URL using API key is a string with a 'b' before it
- Reading the source code and converting into a dictionary can be performed on the same line
## QCC:
- What does a 'b' before a string do to the object? Does it work similarly to the coveted f-string?
- The Specifications/Guidelines in the K23 readme mentions the urllib methods "request.get()" and "request.get().json()" but those methods seem to not be in the urllib documentation? What are they used for?
- key_nasa.txt is necessary to run app.py but should not be tracked by git. Would there be a way to encrypt the key and still have the python file work?
