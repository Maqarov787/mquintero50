DISCO:
* Uncommenting nothing returns two headings and a box for user input with submit next to it (listed as form action="/auth" in login.html)
* methods=['GET', 'POST'] are meant to be inside app.route
* Two types of input types in form in HTML: text which allows user to type and submit which user can click for server to receive data
* Pressing submit sends user to route with /auth that returns the text "Waaaa hooo HAAAH" (name of two inputs and the input in username is also on URL)
* Uncommenting print(request) prints 'http://localhost:5000/' [GET] (request might be defaulted to GET, which is a method that gets the user's input)
* request.args is an ImmutableMultiDict that is empty when message is printed
* Uncommenting print(request.args['username']) returned a Bad Request Key Error b/c request.args is empty
* request.headers returns information about the user and the host
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Q/C/C:
* What is the purpose of methods=['GET', 'POST']? Judging by the name of the list it is a part of, they could be new methods but there are no refs to it anywhere else?
* Why do we need to track the request headers?
* 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


OTHER?
* In usual websites, the submit button doesnt actually redirect the user to another page. It just sends the form response to the url and redirects the user back.
